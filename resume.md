## Objective

Work on data and ai processing, from the development to their deployment, scaling and monitoring. I have experience on developing backend systems, development of data processing systems and their data pipelines with a high level of automation, from the initial development to deployment, testing and validation using the best open-source tools/techniques available.  I’ve worked with several technologies, and I am used to integrate them. Also, I have always worked into creating a better platform to develop and use the technologies on the most productive way for the developers and people involved on the project.  I have experience as engineering manager, planning the work, preparing the deliverables, and supporting a team of developers/data engineers to grow on the role. 

### Technologies:

This is a short summary of the technologies I am working currently:

*  Software development using Go, Python, C and Perl
*  Web-frameworks: Django, Catalyst, Gin
*  Hashicorp Terraform
*  Google Cloud Platform
*  Design of APIs for webservices
*  CI/CD pipelines with gitlab and travisCI
*  Data Extraction, transformation and analysis.
*  MySQL databases and Redis data store.
*  Development of Linux core utils tools and batch automation
*  Linux packages, RPM, Anaconda, Ansible, Embedded Linux 
*  Docker, Docker Compose, multistage builds

I have worked with a number of other technologies and I am flexible on what to use to solve a problem. 

## Experience

### Accenture - Data Engineering Manager - Data & Ai

#### Dec 2021 – present, Amsterdam Area, Netherlands

On Google Cloud team I manage, architect, and plan the delivery of data projects. These projects include new implementations of data projects on google cloud and as well migrations from on-prem to cloud.

The management includes defining the milestones and managing stockholder’s expectations as well guidance and support for the members of the team. As Architect I prepare, choose and bootstrap the solution to be delivered, including plans, tasks and costs to implement the given solution. Also, I do all the steps preparing POC’s and demonstration of a given solution. I have a hands-on approach since my experience as software/data engineer and help the team with technical solutions and code to actual implementation.

The projects I work include external clients, such as large IT providers, telecom companies, banks, and internal projects such as assets and internals frameworks used on our delivery.
My actual project is a deployment data pipeline for data models and pipelines. The goal is to provide a deployment pipeline where the data scientist/developer could prepare his model and deploy on production on defined and replicable way. The pipeline works with the code build on the CI/CD, generate the data manifests with their dependencies and the data is prepared and transfer on airflow pipelines to their correct environments for use.

Previous project was supporting the new pipelines to extract and load the customer data into the data lake. It goes from its validation and quality test to it production version and monitoring. This project uses google cloud data products such as BigQuery, pub/sub and REST.
The first project I worked at was an airflow asset to orchestrate complex legacy dag workflows. To use on migrations, it will get a set of DAG’s and control their execution and dependency externally without changing the DAG’s. The goal is to migrate as smooth as possible reducing the number of changes on production code and giving flexibility to schedule and assembly pipelines with them. Using airflow resources such as subtasks and dagrun the asset will orchestrate the legacy DAG’s on the new cloud environment.
