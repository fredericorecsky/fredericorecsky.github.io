<h1>Frederico random notes on technology</h1>
<p>I am using this space to save my notes about tech stuff, mostly it is my notebook about software. </p>
<p>From time to time I tried to upkeep a blog in the end I fallback to small text files with notes or just commands and now I think that it is more useful than blog posts or videos. </p>
<p>Above there is a list of notes, usually the name is self describing. You can always <a href="https://github.com/fredericorecsky/fredericorecsky.github.io.git">git clone this</a> and git grep the contents.</p>
<h3>About me:</h3>
<p>You can find more about me on <a href="https://frederico.me">my personal blog</a> , my <a href="resume.html">resume</a></p>
<h3>Why notes and not a blog</h3>
<p>The actual format of blogs is not that good to work as a catalog of information. I don't think that of most of cases date are not relevant, but version is.  </p>
<h3>List of notes:</h3>
<p>Here is the list of my notes, more or less by topic, some of them are not finished or just a command to rememeber later.</p>
