# A new day a new project but not a whole new infrastructure

Everyonce in a while every developer starts a side project. It can be to get some extra money or to learn a new technology, it does not matter. 
What really matters is this question: Would I need to recreate all the infrastructure this time again?

  -- Well, likely.
  
If you are a seasoned developer, you may have a set of tools to bootstrap your project on whatever infra you have, so here I am doing a step by step
on how I bootstrap a project on my infra of choice, Google Cloud on this case.  Also keep in mind that this text is about bootstrap and not what should 
be your tool or favorite cloud. The ideia should be the same if you are native k8s or running on AWS, whatever. 

# The Project

Well, this time the project is a simple website so a friend can write some texts and publish.  The goal is write less code as possible and work as well as it can.
Also we are foccused on the content and the user just want to edit some files to publish a text. For this case I will do a poor's man github pages 
using the resources I have and of course I could use github but my friend wants to publish whatever content as he wants, like 18+ for example. 

To mimic the Jekyll + github actions we are going to use:

* Google Cloud Project having: 
* Google Cloud Storage
* Google Cloud Build
* A github repository
* Jekyll 

This is the first time I am doing it so also I want to have a infra setup that I can reuse, so we add Terraform to be our infra control.
What I expect that Terraform will do for me:

* Create a Google Cloud Project
* Create a bucket to serve the site
* Create a Cloud Build Trigger so when the user edits the texts on github, it publishes it. 

Ideally after it is done I expect to forgot about it, except when I need it again and I hope it will be totally reusable.
