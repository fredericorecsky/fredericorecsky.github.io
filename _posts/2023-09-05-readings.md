# Readings 

The readings are grouped by topic, and I put the references on the ideias/topics related from what I read. It is more about what I read about a subject than the article/book/video itself.

## Technology

### Compilers

A nice post from a persin that write small compilers, the [article][1] comments the chanlanges the author had to write a small compiler on 500 lines of python. 
The author uses as target WebAssembly. I never touched it yet and seems interesting for future study. The author chose to do a single-pass but it may be shorter and easier to get a result but I would start with two-pass. The main reason I would write a compiler is to generate/manipulate a given AST.

### Software Management

Checking the [recent study][4] from a big consultancy company about developer productivity. As almost all developers around, I have strong opinions on it but I have being more pragmatic as I got older. I download the pdf from the site and read it. Before I read the article, a lot of blog posts and texts poped to me, I reserved to 
read them only I read the study.  Also you need to register to download the PDF.

The study in my opinion just state the obvious that may be not clear for everybody. There is nothing new, just a well written document with comments for C-levels read. 

[This][5] critique is more about releasing their manifesto than about the article itself. There is an anedotic argument about something like that happened on the company of one of the authors. 

The other articles also goes on the same direction. To make a better software development environment and to measure the productivity you need to be organized first in my opinion.

From the original article, they comment about existing methods to measure the performance

[DORA Metrics][6] 
[SPACE Metrics][7]

### Software Development

I like consensus algorithms so I read about them from time to time, now it is time 
for the [Raft Consensus Algorithm][8] On the page there is a [nice demo][9] that also serves a demo how the old network protocol NetBUIE or something like that works.

The [paper][10] itself looks interesting and will get their own post later 


## Dutch 

This [site is awesome][2], old school site to old school people learn dutch.

## Youtube

[Do Droughts make floods worse?][3] As always the answer is depend. Nice video about something I noticed myself but with a deep engineering perspective. Nice quote from video: "All models are wrong but some of them are useful"
