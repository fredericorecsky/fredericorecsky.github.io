title: Role expectations for an Engineering Manager for Tech

Let's start with the basics, what we call Engineering Manager is just the modern definition of a Team Leader, Supervisor or 1st Line manager. You name it. Simple like that.

The goal still quite the same, just the nuances and the methods are contemporary. Most of the computer technology field is quite new compared to others, like mechanical engineering. Ask any mechanical engineer about their process and work execution, the base where them stand now started to be build more than 100 years ago.  

Computers are not new but *mass usage* of them as production tool is relatively new. We can argue about that but we can pinpoint the growth of google as the main mark as *popular* cluster usage for a front facing product. I personally worked on big clusters before but them were mainly to science, wheather, research, modeling, find oil, etc.  The start of what we call __Cloud Computing__ now can be traced with the boom of companies that uses massive computer power as the core of their product. As example: Search Engines, Huge internet shops, huge online marketing, and so on. 

As we were observing all these developments, the teams that build it were mainly Techies. Most of them computer developers, from computer science courses. This is a huge concentration of culture, where in other areas is quite common a team having differents backgrounds and functions, on Tech you may even have a Medical Doctor or someone that is not graduated at all but they are the minority. And that is what bring me to the main point, the usual company structure and processes, and also their usual faults ( not having adequate processes or tooling ) appear and affect much more on a such homogenous environment. 

For the matter of effect almost all places I worked has a total lack of processes related to the daily work of a team of software developers, normally the processes to assembly a team is something like that:

* We need do something with tech
* A group of people, sometimes with sometimes without technical background and project management experience will decide how they will do that
* they set to hire a number of people
* They split these group of people in groups of 4/5 with one leader
* They distribute the tasks 

This kind of, let's call CHADS ( come here and do stuff ) process, almost don't cover nothing for the real problem.  The engineers will have to:

* Get toghether
* Find a north
* Start doing something meanwhile nothing is clear
* Almost on a ad-hoc form get the requirements, tooling, and everything that is needed to run the project, on the scope of their team and the others.
* The Leader, will report the mess to the upper management and apply random rules or unknown rules to these team that is totally foccused on bootstrap the project 

The time passes and some mitigations appears, like agile, scrum, several other methods that solves some low hanging fruit and we carry on. 

These companies, some of them, grew to the size of literal empires, others also grew big, big enough to be bigger than several centenary companies based on other products that are not direct byproduct of computer technology.  And at this point, the upper management, that also has centuries of rules, studies, cases and procedures that came handy to deal with huge enterprises, has *absolute zero* on common with the processes, routines, culture of their tech departament.  This is the technical debt of Engineering Management of scales-up, start-ups, whatever company that started small and now is a corporation. 

So what we call Engineering Manager today, is the old TL but with the responsability of making these two different cultures somehow work toghether. That is also the reason you are going to see ( at least for sometime but it is getting better) a myriad of job descriptions and requirements for a given Engineering Manager role. 

But the goal of the engineering manager, on tech companies, is to reduce the tech debt of administrative processes and cultural fit between the new empire and his old roots. This engineering manager should ack as a Lawyer of the team, them should know the rules of the company, processes and communication to make the team work as close as possible to the defined goal. 

Looks simple, but it is not. 

Most of us, developers, including myself, are so used to the complete chaos and half baked processes and solutions, that as morpheus pointed on the matrix: 

```You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it```

This is not a just cheap matrix quote, this is real deal. This is my own comment over that:

```Because we got exposed to years of chaos and get used to navigate, deliver and work on it, that we think that we know what the solution should be, and it is not yours, or what the upper management think the solution is.```

Here the role of an Engineering Manager gets darker. The companies are adapting to their size, for the good and for the bad, and it is the Engineering Manager that will implement it, even with all the cultural baggage of the team. 

That is why I think that an Engineering Manager should see himself as a Lawyer of the team. Knowing the rules and the cultural nuances makes easier to help implement, deliver and also keep the team on track and motivated to work. For most of the companies the EM will be the agent of changing the cultural status quo of the development team. 

Also that works for the other side, the EM will represent the team when is necessary argument about these processes and rules, goals, architecture, deliverables. To do that he will always prepare his case.  As an example:

-- A developer wants to use a new X technology, he thinks that it is really better and etc. 

The goal here is not to made the decision, is help this developer either prepare his case and defend it on the best interest of the company, or help him find out why this new X technology will be not be used and *understand* that.  Sometimes the reason will be that the company decided that on the next projects it will not change the stack and understand why is part of the job of the developer and make it *clear* why is the job of the Engineer Manager. 

Compared to the old Team Leader general status quo, where the company is not on the same level of maturity of example companies I wrote before, so they will have to also come up with the "laws", processes, roadmaps, methods. I consider this quite a challange, because now you are at the sametime the lawyer and the legislator. On worse case scenarios you will also be the judge.   You need to create all the framework of work for the team and the team itself will be likely bootstraping a new web framework. 

Given that the Tech field is relative new, the Engineering Manager is the role that will join the past with the future of the work on it, being the lawyer, partner and mentor of the team.
