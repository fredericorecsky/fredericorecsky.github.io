This post is about how a descentralized and asyncronous social network should be.

## An old tale from an old man

I always liked the social side of the internet. From my old geocities site to talk to strangers on ICQ, IRC and other 3 letters messagers ( AIM, MSN ... ) to the mastodon. Receiving the news from friends/acquiatances on a kind of feed is one of my favorites readings. 

During the time that blog was popular, I used to create aggregations using rss myself from my favorites bloggers and so on, until in the end somehow the social networks practically monopolized the individual content production.

## Modern Social Network Problems

### Who is responsable for the platform?

### Who is responsable for the content?

The moment you use a social network, you kinda relinquish all the rights over your content to be monetized by the host but also get the blame for everything that has consequences on the content. 

It is the worse of both worlds for the user, you give away your rights and get the responsability for the content. *In the end of the day you pay a huge price for a glorified blog engine with a rss feed of your "friends/connections"

### Overcomplex protocols ActivityPub

The ideia is great, but IMHO the protocol and the implementations are quite complex.  It is hard to do anything for one user or a set of users and the implementations that exist, like mastodon, more replicate the failed model of the private social networks that a truly descentralized social network.
