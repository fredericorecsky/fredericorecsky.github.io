Quite hard to organize bookmarks when you have several devices and several contexts where you navigate the internet. Also the division between work, personal and even personal "work", makes things hard to organize. 

## My solution for bookmarks

My solution is always chaning, but I ended up splitting into three groups, personal, work/studies, work on work environment. 

* For personal use, since I use apple devices, I stick with safari and the icloud sync them to me. Good enough. 
* For "personal" work and studies, I use the pinboard, that I have account for years and I kept the applet it on my bookmark bar because normally I study and work on my desktop. 
* Work as working for an employer, I use the solution they gave or suggest. 

## Readings

Every week or so I publish the articles and books that I am reading with comments and annotations. My flux goes to bookmark a link on pinboard when I want to dig on them, and later took a time to read it and write down whatever comes to mind as study.
