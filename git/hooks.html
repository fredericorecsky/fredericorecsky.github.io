<h1>Git hooks</h1>

<p>Run scripts on given actions.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/githooks.txt">Main doc</a></p>

<p>Just copy one of the examples available on the .git/hooks and remove the sample from filename and add +x to the file. </p>

<p>Note that the hooks that you create don't get updated on repo, if you want to share it with others you need to add it inside the repo and configure the git client to use that dir for hooks.</p>
