# Frederico random notes on technology

I am using this space to save my notes about tech stuff, mostly it is my notebook about software. 

From time to time I tried to upkeep a blog in the end I fallback to small text files with notes or just commands and now I think that it is more useful than blog posts or videos. 

Above there is a list of notes, usually the name is self describing. You can always [git clone this](https://github.com/fredericorecsky/fredericorecsky.github.io.git) and git grep the contents.

Recently I moved to use jekyll and github pages. Some of the blog posts are just old notes so they seem to be incomplete but is just a note for myself :)
