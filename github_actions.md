# GitHub Actions 

## Links

[Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

### Cases/Usages

Generate the CMS data files for a static site. Just to keep the basic structure. When the repo that has the data is pushed just regenerate them.

Followed the [quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) and created a workflow for my personal website so it generates a basic list of links to display on the main page.
