<h1>Random notes on technology</h1>

<p>I am using this space to save my notes about tech stuff, mostly it is my notebook about software. </p>

<p>From time to time I tried to upkeep a blog in the end I fallback to small text files with notes or just commands and now I think that it is more useful than blog posts or videos. </p>

<p>Above there is a list of notes, usually the name is self describing. You can always [git clone this] ( https://github.com/fredericorecsky/fredericorecsky.github.io.git ) and git grep the contents.</p>
